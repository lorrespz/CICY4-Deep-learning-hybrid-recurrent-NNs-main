# CICY4: Deep learning Hodge numbers with hybrid CNN-RNN and purely recurrent LSTM-based networks

## Introduction

In this work, we explored hybrid CNN-RNN and LSTM-based architectures for learning the Hodge numbers of CICY4. 

The organization of this repo is as follows:
  - The training notebooks for the 12 models are contained in the folders 'Models_CNN-RNN-hybrid' and 'Models_LSTM-based'.
  - The trained models are saved in the folder 'Results_p2_Trained_models'.

## Training results

The performances of the 12 models can be seen the figure below.
