# CICY4: Deep learning Hodge numbers with hybrid CNN-RNN and purely recurrent LSTM-based networks

## Introduction

In this work, we explored hybrid CNN-RNN and LSTM-based architectures for learning the Hodge numbers of CICY4. 

## Training results

The performances of the 12 models can be seen the figure below.
